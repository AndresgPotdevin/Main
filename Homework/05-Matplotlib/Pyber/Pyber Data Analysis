Pyber Data Analysis

While observing the data from Pyber we can notice a few trends at glance:

Urban cities have by far the highest demand for rides, as well as the highest
number of drivers available. Rural, as expected is the opposite, while suburban
cities lie somewhere in the middle.

The availability and ease of access of Urban cities does bring the cost of rides
down, making it overall the cheapest demographic. Suburban and rural cities trend
to have similar average prices, with rural having a few outliers on the higher end.

Even though Suburban cities can have the highest costs per ride, suburban cities
seem to have a more consistent demand for rides, while still maintaining the
prices fairly high compared to urban cities. Overall, it seems that Suburban
could be the most profitable segment for un Uber driver, having less competition
while maintaining higher ride fees.
